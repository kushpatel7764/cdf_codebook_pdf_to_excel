UNIQUE RESPONDENT NUMBER (CROSS-YEAR ID FOR
VCF0006a
PANEL CASES)
Question Unique identification number
Notes GENERAL NOTE:
For non-panel cases this corresponds to 4-digit year of study followed
by 4-digit case id from the study as found in VCF0006.
For panel cases, this corresponds to 4-digit year of first year of
time-series participation followed by 4-digit case id from first
participation study . For example, 1958 ANES panel cases (first
interviewed in the 1956 anes) are numbered 1956xxxx where xxxx
corresponds to the case ID the respondent had been assigned previously
in the 1956 study; VCF0006, by contrast, includes the respondent’s 1958
ANES case ID.
Studies including panel cases as part of the overall study cross-section
are flagged in VCF00016.
1958 NOTE:
In the 1958 anes time-series study, V580007 and V580008 flags whether
1958 respondents were previously interviewed in 1956. However, some
respondents flagged in these variables had been interviewed in 1956 not
as part of the 1956 anes study’s cross-section sample, but as part of a
sample component intended for a separate ‘panel’ (non-cross-section)
file. Thus the actual count of cases from the 1958 study having 1956
unique IDs in VCF0006a (as 1956xxxx, where xxxx is the 1956 ANES
cross-section case ID) does not correspond with the count of cases
flagged in V580007 and V580008 for previous participation in 1956.
1960 NOTE:
see 1958 NOTE; cases flagged in the 1960 ANES study for participation
prior to 1960 may have participated outside of the time-series cross-
section(s) in the year(s) of prior participation and may not correspond
to the count of cases found here for initial time-series participation.
